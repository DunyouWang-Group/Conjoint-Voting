This project hosts the data and source code for the paper “Machine Learning to Predict Atomic-Level Mechanisms of Chemical Reactions”.

The learning and verifying datasets, as well as the original 1700 learning and 300 verifying trajectories, are organized in ten classes.

You need to download all parts of the compressed file before decompression. Incomplete download will cause decompression to fail.

The file name of the CSV file in the dataset is divided into four parts with "$MFBMFB$": the collision energy of the current trajectory, class, impact parameter (b) and trajectory id (used to distinguish different trajectories).

For the actual classes of 300 verifying trajectories, please refer to " Supplementary Information for 300 Verifying Trajectories. xlsx".

The "Samples" folder contains Python code and NWChem input sample files

System Requirements:
1.	Python 3.8         https://www.python.org/
2.	Scikit-learn 0.22    https://scikit-learn.org/stable/
