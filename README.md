This project hosts the data and source code for the paper “Prediction of atomic-level mechanism of Chemical Reaction Based on Machine Learning”.

Raw data and Organized Datasets are organized in ten classes.

All compressed files need to be downloaded before decompression, incomplete download will cause decompression failure.

The file name of the CSV file in the Organized Datasets is splitted by "$MFBMFB$", it sequentially represents the collision energy of the current trajectory, class , the impact parameters (b) and trajectory number.

The true classes of 300 verifying trajectories, please refer to “Supplementary Information for 300 Verifying Trajectories.xlsx”.

System Requirements:
1.	Python 3.8           https://www.python.org/
2.	Scikit-learn 0.22    https://scikit-learn.org/stable/
